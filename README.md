# Dash

**Project manager, application orchestrator, & internet presence dashboard.**  
Deploy live updates, monitor apps & resources, and plan projects â€“ *all in realtime from the cloud.*  

## Features
**Dash** ties abstract ideas and goals to models of concrete entities, generating smart server configurations for your projects based on a few high-level settings for the software and hardware you manage.  
&nbsp;  
*It simplifies the following:*  
 - Project Management
    - Project stages & tasks
    - Ideation/solution design
 - Application Orchestration
    - Server process management
    - Reverse proxy generation
 - Internet Presence
    - Web sitemap generation
    - Domain tracking

## Guides
*A few setup guides for the cloud server & resource daemon software*  
### VM Setup
Setting up a cloud VM to host both `dash-cloud` and `dash-daemon` processes.
 - Create/choose application root directory, for example `/home/ubuntu/dash/apps`
 - PM2 setup
    - Install `pm2` globally with `npm`
    - Manually start/stop apps from dash's `ecosystem.json` (dash-cloud & dash-daemon) as needed using `pm2 start ecosystem.json` and `pm2 stop APP_NAME`
    - Dash's application management will bring up the other apps automatically with PM2
 - NGINX setup
    - Install `nginx` with system package manager (ie. `apt`)
    - Check `config/nginx/reference` folder for example `nginx.conf` main configuration
    - Ensure folders `/etx/nginx/sites-enabled` and `/etc/nginx/sites-available` exist
        - Ensure current `$USER` has write permissions to those folders
    - Add sites `dash-cloud.conf` and `dash-proxy_apache.conf` from repo folder `config/nginx` to VM folder `/etc/nginx/sites-available`
        - Then link with `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dash-cloud.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dash-cloud.conf` and restart NGINX
    - Ensure current `$USER` has the ability to start, stop, and restart the nginx service without requiring a password for sudo
        - One possible solution
            - Create/edit `/etc/sudoers.d/$USER` (ie. `/etc/sudoers.d/ubuntu`) to contain:
                ```
                ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service nginx start,/usr/sbin/service nginx stop,/usr/sbin/service nginx restart,/usr/sbin/service nginx reload
                ```
